Model
	-calculate correlations for training data (i.e. 2014-2017)
	-create test dataset (i.e. 2017-2019)
	-Take the training correlations at a certain cutoff and build some model from scratch
	-Model options:
		-predict price
		-only decide buy/sell based on predicted increase/decrease
		-model can decide when to buy and when to sell
		-model only chooses to buy and sells regardless after a certain period
		-Voting model where best comps vote whether to buy or sell, and make decision when % meets a threshold
		-weight votes by correlation over a given period, perhaps use a variety of different correlation calculations (vary period length,
		 time between periods, etc.) and have many submodels vote
	-Backtest model on test dataset
